      <p>
    I’m <strong>Mohamed Ali MHADHBI</strong>, but most people just call me Dali. I’m <span id="age">23</span> years old, and i'm a <strong>Full Stack Developer</strong>. I’ve always had this strange fascination with code, the kind where you lose track of time fixing something small and suddenly the whole project makes sense. That feeling is what keeps me moving.
</p>

<p>
    I was born in Sousse, Tunisia on 16 November 2001. I graduated from high school in June 2021 as an Economics and Business student, but somewhere along the way, thanks to video games, curiosity, and a few late-night experiments, I realized I belonged in the world of programming. That’s what led me to El Manar Campus to pursue a bachelor’s degree in IT.
</p>

<p>
    In September 2024, I moved to Bari, Italy. Since then, I’ve been learning as much as I can, building things that matter to me, and pushing myself through advanced courses and hands-on projects. I’m the kind of person who can’t sit still when there’s something new to understand or create.
</p>

<p>
    I speak <strong>Arabic</strong>, <strong>English</strong>, and <strong>French</strong>, and I’ve reached a solid B2 level in <strong>Italian</strong>. I love working with people from different places, sharing ideas, and explaining complicated things in a simple way. Teaching and mentoring have helped me grow too guiding others teaches you a lot about yourself.
